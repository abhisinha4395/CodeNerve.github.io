My favorite code quote, "<span id="k">The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit</span>". <!-- sjkfhskjf -->

Hey There! I am Abhijeet Sinha.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>As a coder this is where I thrive. So, it felt befitting to have a portfolio in my natural habitat.</p>
<p> I love to code, play video games, and go on road trips.</p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology, Sikkim, India (SMIT).</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->
<p> I have been a Python Developer since then. I have worked on multiple projects right from the designing, execution and to the maintainence phase. In the last 4 years, I have picked up many skills in Backend Development, Databases, ML, DevOps and CI/CD, primarily being Python and Linux. </p><!-- kjdhjhgdgldjhgdwtoiewotwotjdfkjdfffsf -->
<p>I have worked at a startup and currently I'm working for a MNC. One thing you may notice about me is that I'm a DIY kind of guy. I like to go into the nitty gritty of things rather than using a software to make my life easier.<br><br><br></p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->
